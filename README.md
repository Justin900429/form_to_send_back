## Problem to slove
In order to send the Google Form results to others without giving the form permission, I created an application that creators can easily send the form results with email.

## Technique
1. App script

## How to use
1. Get the form's edit URL. The edit page should look below illustration.
> **Note that the users need the permission to edit the forms**.

2. Go to the [webiste](http://justin900429.github.io/form_to_send_back/)
  * Paste in the URL and gmail as the hint.
  * Press the send button.
 
3. The page will redirect back to the finish page.

## Further plan
Add the functionality of sending Form results' plots.
